In the outside APUG spreadsheet the entries marked in violet are new additions. Wherever had a letter an archival manifestation as well as printed copy, I kept only the achival one and put the printed edition into notes to avoid duplicity where possible. I have seen Mirto article from 2000 as well so hopefully all obvious sources have been checked. 
I have added various new letters from a recent German archival source called Kalliope. 
The list may need some stardandization. 
The new names from Kircher_outside APUG are NOT! in BIO_DATA spreadsheet as we were not sure how to incorporate them (how to add language and number of letters cell). IL
